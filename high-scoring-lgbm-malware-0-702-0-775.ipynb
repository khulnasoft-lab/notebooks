Since the competition is over, we can now discuss the secret 12 engineered features! This model scores 0.702 public LB and 0.775 private LB with a single LGBM. (As part of an ensemble, it scores 0.707 LB [here][2].)\n\n# Why did this model come in 1435th place?\nThe private dataset contains 33% outliers. Those outliers ruin every model's score. This is explained [here][1]. When those outliers are removed, this model scores an amazing 0.775 AUC !!  \n  \nEven if you fit the clean data (sine wave pattern below) perfectly, the presence of outliers adds so much error that your model's AUC is terrible. See model one below. The presence of outliers hurt the most accurate solutions the most. If your solution only fits the data (sine wave pattern) loosely, then you have a chance of being near the outliers and may receive a better private LB score as seen in model two below.\n  \n  \n![image](http://playagricola.com/Kaggle/errorone31919.png)  \n  \n![image](http://playagricola.com/Kaggle/errortwo31919.png)\n\n# Load Data and Fix Pandas Memory Leak  \n  \n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/discussion/84745\n[2]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/discussion/84135","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# monkeypatches.py\n\n# Solving memory leak problem in pandas\n# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/2659#issuecomment-12021083\nimport pandas as pd, sys\nfrom ctypes import cdll, CDLL\ntry:\n    cdll.LoadLibrary(\"libc.so.6\")\n    libc = CDLL(\"libc.so.6\")\n    libc.malloc_trim(0)\nexcept (OSError, AttributeError):\n    libc = None\n\n__old_del = getattr(pd.DataFrame, '__del__', None)\n\ndef __new_del(self):\n    if __old_del:\n        __old_del(self)\n    libc.malloc_trim(0)\n\nif libc:\n    print('Applying monkeypatch for pd.DataFrame.__del__', file=sys.stderr)\n    pd.DataFrame.__del__ = __new_del\nelse:\n    print('Skipping monkeypatch for pd.DataFrame.__del__: libc or malloc_trim() not found', file=sys.stderr)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.397824Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.398252Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.425402Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.398110Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.424423Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Applying monkeypatch for pd.DataFrame.__del__\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# SET THIS VARIABLE TO TRUE TO RUN KERNEL QUICKLY AND FIND BUGS\n# ONLY 10000 ROWS OF DATA IS LOADED\nDebug = False\n\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd, gc, random\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef load(x):\n    ignore = ['MachineIdentifier']\n    if x in ignore: return False\n    else: return True\n\n# LOAD TRAIN AND TEST\nif Debug:\n    df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/microsoft-malware-prediction/train.csv',dtype='category',usecols=load,nrows=10000)\nelse:\n    df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/microsoft-malware-prediction/train.csv',dtype='category',usecols=load, nrows=1000000)\ndf_train['HasDetections'] = df_train['HasDetections'].astype('int8')\nif 5244810 in df_train.index:\n    df_train.loc[5244810,'AvSigVersion'] = '1.273.1144.0'\n    df_train['AvSigVersion'].cat.remove_categories('1.2&#x17;3.1144.0',inplace=True)\n\nif Debug:\n    df_test = pd.read_csv('../input/microsoft-malware-prediction/test.csv',dtype='category',usecols=load,nrows=10000)\nelse:\n    df_test = pd.read_csv('../input/microsoft-malware-prediction/test.csv',dtype='category',usecols=load, nrows=1000000)\n    \nprint('Loaded',len(df_train),'rows of TRAIN and',len(df_test),'rows of TEST')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.426895Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.427333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T20:56:15.256715Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:54:34.427246Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T20:56:15.255594Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Loaded 1000000 rows of TRAIN and 1000000 rows of TEST\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Define Encoding Functions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# FREQUENCY ENCODE SEPARATELY\ndef encode_FE(df,col):\n    vc = df[col].value_counts(dropna=False, normalize=True).to_dict()\n    nm = col+'_FE'\n    df[nm] = df[col].map(vc)\n    df[nm] = df[nm].astype('float32')\n    return [nm]\n\n# FREQUENCY ENCODE TOGETHER\ndef encode_FE2(df1, df2, col):\n    df = pd.concat([df1[col],df2[col]])\n    vc = df.value_counts(dropna=False, normalize=True).to_dict()\n    nm = col+'_FE2'\n    df1[nm] = df1[col].map(vc)\n    df1[nm] = df1[nm].astype('float32')\n    df2[nm] = df2[col].map(vc)\n    df2[nm] = df2[nm].astype('float32')\n    return [nm]\n\n# FACTORIZE\ndef factor_data(df_train, df_test, col):\n    df_comb = pd.concat([df_train[col],df_test[col]],axis=0)\n    df_comb,_ = df_comb.factorize(sort=True)\n    #

You must engineer the following five variables. (The other half is frequency encoding 7 variables described below.). These variables were discovered by trying hundreds of engineered variables to see which ones increased Time Split Validation (TSV explained [here][1]). Each variable was added to the model one at a time and validation score was recorded. Only the follow 5 variables increased validation score.\n\n* `AppVersion2` indicates whether your Windows Defender is up to date. This is the second number from AppVersion. Regardless of your operating system and version, you can always have AppVersion with second number equal 18. For example, you should have `4.18.1807.18075` instead of `4.12.xx.xx`.\n\n* `Lag1` is the difference between AvSigVersion_Date and Census_OSVersion_Date. Since AvSigVersion is the virus definitions for Windows Defender, this variable indicates whether Windows Defender is out-of-date by comparing it's last install with the date of the operating system. Out-of-date antivirus indicates that a user either has better antivirus or they don't use their computer often. In either case, they have less HasDetections.\n\n* `Lag5` is the difference between AvSigVersion_Date and July 26, 2018. The first observation in Microsoft's training data is July 26, 2018. Therefore if a computer has AvSigVersion_Date before this then their antivirus is out-of-date. (The first observation in the test data is September 27, so you use this difference when encoding the test data.)\n\n* `driveA` is the ratio of harddrive partition used for the operating system with the total hard drive. Savy users install multiple operating systems and have a lower ratio. Savy users have reduced HasDetections.\n\n* `driveB` is the difference between harddrive partition used for the operating system and total hard drive. Responsible users manager their hard drives well. Responsible users have reduced HasDetections.  \n  \n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/time-split-validation-malware-0-68","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta\n\n# AS timestamp\ndatedictAS = np.load('../input/malware-timestamps/AvSigVersionTimestamps.npy')[()]\ndf_train['DateAS'] = df_train['AvSigVersion'].map(datedictAS)\ndf_test['DateAS'] = df_test['AvSigVersion'].map(datedictAS)\n\n# OS timestamp\ndatedictOS = np.load('../input/malware-timestamps-2/OSVersionTimestamps.npy')[()]\ndf_train['DateOS'] = df_train['Census_OSVersion'].map(datedictOS)\ndf_test['DateOS'] = df_test['Census_OSVersion'].map(datedictOS)\n\n# ENGINEERED FEATURE #1\ndf_train['AppVersion2'] = df_train['AppVersion'].map(lambda x: np.int(x.split('.')[1]))\ndf_test['AppVersion2'] = df_test['AppVersion'].map(lambda x: np.int(x.split('.')[1]))\n\n# ENGINEERED FEATURE #2\ndf_train['Lag1'] = df_train['DateAS'] - df_train['DateOS']\ndf_train['Lag1'] = df_train['Lag1'].map(lambda x: x.days//7)\ndf_test['Lag1'] = df_test['DateAS'] - df_test['DateOS']\ndf_test['Lag1'] = df_test['Lag1'].map(lambda x: x.days//7)\n\n# ENGINEERED FEATURE #3\ndf_train['Lag5'] = datetime(2018,7,26) - df_train['DateAS']\ndf_train['Lag5'] = df_train['Lag5'].map(lambda x: x.days//1)\ndf_train.loc[ df_train['Lag5']<0, 'Lag5' ] = 0\ndf_test['Lag5'] = datetime(2018,9,27) - df_test['DateAS'] #PUBLIC TEST\ndf_test['Lag5'] = df_test['Lag5'].map(lambda x: x.days//1)\ndf_test.loc[ df_test['Lag5']<0, 'Lag5' ] = 0\ndf_train['Lag5'] = df_train['Lag5'].astype('float32') # allow for NAN\ndf_test['Lag5'] = df_test['Lag5'].astype('float32') # allow for NAN\n\n# ENGINEERED FEATURE #4\ndf_train['driveA'] = df_train['Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity'].astype('float')/df_train['Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity'].astype('float')\ndf_test['driveA'] = df_test['Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity'].astype('float')/df_test['Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity'].astype('float')\ndf_train['driveA'] = df_train['driveA'].astype('float32') \ndf_test['driveA'] = df_test['driveA'].astype('float32') \n\n# ENGINNERED FEATURE #5\ndf_train['driveB'] = df_train['Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity'].astype('float') - df_train['Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity'].astype('float')\ndf_test['driveB'] = df_test['Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity'].astype('float') - df_test['Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity'].astype('float')\ndf_train['driveB'] = df_train['driveB'].astype('float32') \ndf_test['driveB'] = df_test['driveB'].astype('float32') \n\ncols6=['Lag1']\ncols8=['Lag5','driveB','driveA']\n\ndel df_train['DateAS'], df_train['DateOS'] #, df_train['DateBL']\ndel df_test['DateAS'], df_test['DateOS'] #, df_test['DateBL']\ndel datedictAS, datedictOS\nx=gc.collect()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:56:15.281743Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:56:15.282086Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T20:57:17.615289Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:56:15.282016Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T20:57:17.614439Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Frequency Engineering\nThis is the second half of the secret sauce. There is a correlation between the frequency of time variables (`EngineVersion`, `AvSigVersion`, `AppVersion`, `Census_OSVersion`, `Census_OSBuildRevision`) and `HasDetections`. This occurs for two reasons explained [here][1]. One reason is a leak and will lead to overfitting train and public test because I believe that private test is a random sample and therefore does not benefit from the leak. The second reason is because out-of-date antivirus produces a front tail with both reduced frequency and reduced HasDetections (explained and verified [here][1]). To take advantage of these two correlations, you need to frequency encode the time variables **separately** for train and test. (Also since EngineVersion and AppVersion have low cardinality, I found that frequency encoded them doesn't increase CV or LB.)  \n\nThere is an actual correlation between frequency of `CountryIdentifier` and `HasDetections`. This is probably because popular countries are targeted. Also there is a true correlation between frequency of `Census_InternalBatteryNumberOfCharges` and `HasDetections`.

Therefore validation shows that it is best to label encode variables (`pd.factorize(df[col],sort=True)`) into ordered integers and input them into LGBM as integers. Then set `num_leaves=2048` and LGBM has no trouble finding the categories anyway.  \n  \nAfter every variable was changed to dtype integer, each variable was tested one by one to see if making it categorical increases LGBM validation score.

We \"remove it\" by changing that computer's `EngineVersion` to a new category value of `TrashCan`.\n  \n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/time-split-validation-malware-0-68","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Factorizing...')\nfor col in cols+cols2+cols6:\n    factor_data(df_train, df_test, col)\nprint('Relaxing data...')\nfor col in cols+cols2: relax_data(df_train, df_test, col)\nprint('Optimizing memory...')\nfor col in cols+cols2+cols6:\n    reduce_memory(df_train, col)\n    reduce_memory(df_test, col)\n# Converting 6 variables to categorical\ncategorize(df_train, df_test, cols2)\n    \nprint('Number of variables is',len(cols+cols2+cols3+cols6+cols8))\ndisplay_memory(df_train, df_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:57:21.738844Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:57:21.739169Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.264403Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:57:21.739095Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.263415Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Factorizing...\nRelaxing data...\nOptimizing memory...\nNumber of variables is 76\n1000000 rows of training data use 115.0 Mb memory!\n1000000 rows of test data use 114.0 Mb memory!\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"microsoft_100w_train_data = df_train[cols+cols2+cols3+cols6+cols8]\nmicrosoft_100w_train_label = df_train['HasDetections']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.266714Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.267160Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.631235Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.267027Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.629316Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"microsoft_100w_train_data.to_csv(\"/kaggle/working/microsoft_100w_train_data.csv\", index=False)\nmicrosoft_100w_train_label.to_csv(\"/kaggle/working/microsoft_100w_train_label.csv\", index=False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.632660Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.632930Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-11T21:00:16.455024Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-11T20:58:09.632886Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-11T21:00:16.453983Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]}]}
